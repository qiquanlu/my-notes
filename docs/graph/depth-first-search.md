## Implementation 


## Complexity 
Time Complexity: <b><i>O(V+E)</i></b>. 

Here, V represents the number of vertices, and E represents the number of edges. We need to check every vertex and traverse through every edge in the graph.

Space Complexity: <b><i>O(V)</i></b>.

 Either the manually created stack or the recursive call stack can store up to V vertices.
