::: tip Where the OA comes from?

Amazon is hosting a team hackathon. 1. Each team will have exactly teamSize developers. 2. A developer's skill level is denoted by skill[i]. 3. The difference between the maximum and minimum skill levels within a team cannot exceed a threshold, maxDiff.

Determine the maximum number of teams that can be formed from the contestants.

## Example
skill = 3, 4, 3, 1, 6, 5, teamSize = 3, maxDiff = 2: At most, 2 teams can be formed: 3, 3, 1 and 4, 6, 5. The difference between the maximum and minimum skill levels is 2 in each case, which does not exceed the threshold value of 2.
