Amazon Shopping recently launched a new Coin Collection Album. Each page has a coin pasted on it, with either the head or tail side facing upward, represented by 'H'and 'T' respectively. A sequence of coins is called beautiful if all the head-facing coins are pasted before all the tail-facing coins. More formally, a beautiful sequence is a sequence of the form "HH.....TTT".

One of the buyers has a hobby of collecting and organizing coins. The buyer pastes n coins on n pages and then wishes to organize them into a beautiful sequence. Given the initial sequence of coins, find the minimum number of coins that must be flipped to obtain a beautiful sequence.

Note that a sequence containing all head facing coins, or all tail facing coins is also valid.

## Example
coins ="HHTHTT"

Flip the fourth coin to obtain the beautiful sequence "HHTTTT".

The answer is 1.

Note that this is the minimum number of coins that must be flipped to make the coin sequence beautiful.
